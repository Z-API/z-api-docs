## Integrating partner

### Welcome

Se você esta neste tópico ja quebrou algumas castanhas com a gente não é mesmo ?

If you are on this topic you've already busted your chops with us, aint that right?

We are very happy for you to consider being an integrator partner of ours, we really want to be a blessing in your business and we hope you prosper a lot, and of course we hope to be able to help in this endeavor. So now that you have reached 25 licenses, we already know each other well and our partnership gets even stronger. We will be here ready to help you and grow together, so count on us !

### Integrator model 

By joining the integrator program, your company will receive an integrator token and documentation for creating/subscribing/canceling instances all via api without the need to access our admin interface.

### Integrador token

The tokens contain a limited number of uses, but during our partnership this limit goes through some changes as mentioned below 

#### First token

> It allows creating 25 instances, when reaching this number the integrator must request its new token.

#### Second token

> Allows you to create +25 instances, with the value of the second tariff band.

#### Third token

> Allows you to create +50 instances, with the value of the third and last tariff band.

#### Definitive token 

> The Sky is the limit with this one ;)

---

### IMPORTANT

- The customer is responsible for using the token, remember that your company is financially responsible for all instances created, so avoid using it in test mode.
- When creating an instance it comes with the default 2 days of trial, after this period the instance will stop and one of us will delete the instance, if you want to keep the instance you need to call the signature method. It is not necessary to call the cancel method in this case as the instance is still a trial.
- The integrator model at the moment is post-paid, soon we will have pre-paid.
---

### Invoicing 

Our billing cycle works as follows:

- Every instance signed between the 1st and the 31st will be grouped and made available in a single payment due on the 5th of the next month.

- Canceled instances will remain active until their expiration date, that is, if canceled today, they will still be charged on the next invoice and will be available for use until their original expiration date.

- All instances have an expiration date on the 10th, which will be the maximum term for the service to function in cases of non-payment, on the 15th our DevOps will delete all instances from the account.

:::tip How to charge your clients 

We recommend our customers to use the prepaid model in their solutions as we do not work on a pro rata basis.

:::caution Attention 

After joining the partnership plan you will have to create instances only and exclusively via API, the instances created in the admin panel will not be activated.
