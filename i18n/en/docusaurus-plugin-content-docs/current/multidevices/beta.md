## About beta Z-API multi-device

We are here **pulling our hairs out** to be able to deliver in the most transparent way possible all the news of this new version for you :)

With the same transparency as always, we need to tell you that really almost nothing was used from the previous version, we had to create a new version where little was used from the previous one. This was very cool because we managed to improve our performance and stability even more.


During this process our team worked hard to deliver the same experience as before with the benefits of this new version. Our tests are thorough and comprehensive, but as any good Dev you already know that at some point we will be able to identify some information that went unnoticed in our tests and when this happens know that we will be here to look for a solution as soon as possible and in record time.
