## Concept

In this method you will be able to send simple texts, you can add to them by using the formatting of text and emojis. In case you don‚Äôt know how to do that, you can click the links below and follow the instructions:

- To format texts on WhatsApp [click here] 

- You can also use line breaks in your messages however, this can be done in different ways. This will depend on the platform that you are using as well as the language, up until this moment we have identified the following.


  > - \n
  > - \r
  > - \r\n
  > - %0a

  Identify which will be the most adequate for your case.

  **If you can find a different way of doing a line break please let us know :)**
- Another resource that you can explore and use are emojis,  if need be you can find a few here [link]
