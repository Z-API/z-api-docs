## Method 

#### /send-audio

`POST` https://api.z-api.io/instances/YOUR_INSTANCE/token/YOUR_TOKEN/send-audio

---

## Concept 

Method responsible for sending audios to your chats, you can work with two types of audios which are: 

 - By link, where you have an audio hosted somewhere on the internet and it sends the audio’s link 

 - By Base64. If you have opted for this option you will need to have a method on your website to convert the audio to Base64.

### Sizes and formats

WhatsApp limits the sizes of files and its politics constantly changes and because of that we always recommend that you verify directly on WhatsApp’s website.

In this [link]  you can find everything that you need to know about formatting and file sizing.
