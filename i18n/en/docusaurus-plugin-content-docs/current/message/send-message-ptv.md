## Concept

The acronym PTV comes from "Pre-Recorded Transfer Video".

Method responsible for sending PTV to your chats. You can work with PTV in 2 ways:

By Link: Where you have a video hosted somewhere on the internet and send only the link to it.

By Base64: If you choose this option, you will need to have a method in your application to convert the video to Base64.

### Size and formats

WhatsApp limits the size of files, and its policy changes constantly. Therefore, we always recommend checking directly on WhatsApp's website for the most up-to-date information.

In this [link], you will find everything you need to know about file formats and sizes.
