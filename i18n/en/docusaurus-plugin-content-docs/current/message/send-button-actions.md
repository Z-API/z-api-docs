## Attributes

### Required

| Attributes   | Type   | Description |
| :-------     | :-:    | :-------    |
| phone        | string | Recipient (or group ID in case you want to send it to a group) telephone number in the format DDI DDD NUMERS Ex: 551199999999. IMPORTANT  only send numbers without formatting or a mask |
| message       | string | Text to be sent|
| buttonActions | buttonActions[] | Type array of buttonActions |

### buttonActions

| Attributes   | Type   | Description |
| :-------- | :----: | :---------------------------- |
| type      | string | Types of buttons to be sent (CALL, URL, REPLY) |
| phone     | string | Number assigned to the button if it is of type CALL |
| url       | string | Link assigned to the button if it is of type URL.   |
| label     | string | Text for the button |

:::tip Dica:
The WhatsApp has a specific link for copying texts. By using this link in the 'url' attribute, your button becomes a copy button (https://www.whatsapp.com/otp/code/?otp_type=COPY_CODE&code=otpyourcode)
:::

### Optional buttons

| Attributes| Type   | Description |
| :-------- | :----: | :---------------------       |
| id        | string | Button identifier            |

### Optional
| Attributes   | Type   | Description |
| :---------   | :----: | :--------   |
| delayMessage | number | In this attribute a delay is added to the message. You can decide between a range of 1 - 15 secs (this is for how many seconds it will wait to send the next message EX: “delayMessage”:5,). The default delay is between 1 - 3 secs |
| title     | string | If you want to send a title  |
| footer    | string | If you want to send a footer |

---

:::tip Observation:
Currently, when sending the three types of buttons simultaneously, WhatsApp Web generates an error, which also occurs when using Meta's own API. An alternative is to send only the CALL and URL buttons together, and always send the REPLY button separately.
