## Concept

Method responsible for sending videos to your chats, you can work with two types of videos which are: 

 - By link, where you have a video hosted somewhere on the internet and it sends the audio’s link 

 - By Base64. If you have opted for this option you will need to have a method on your website to convert the video to Base64.

### Size and formats 

WhatsApp limits the sizes of files and its politics constantly changes and because of that we always recommend that you verify directly on WhatsApp’s website.

In this [link] you can find everything that you need to know about formatting and file sizing.
