## Method

#### /send-document/{extension}

`POST` https://api.z-api.io/instances/YOUR_INSTANCE/token/YOUR_TOKEN/send-document/ **{extension}**


> **Don’t forget!** You need to inform the **{extension}** parameter with the extension of the file you want to send! Theoretically this method should support all types of documents, as long as they are within WhatsApp's own file size policies (to know more about these limits [click here]).

### Size and formats 

O Whatsapp limita o tamanho de arquivos e sua politica muda constantemente, por isso sempre recomendamos a verificação direto no site do próprio Whatsapp.

Neste [link] você encontra tudo que precisa saber sobre formatos e tamanhos de arquivos.
