## Concept

This method is responsible for giving you information about the health of your instance on Z-API. For good quality sending and receiving it is necessary to take the following precautions:

- Configure your webhooks on Z-API to receive notifications about changes on the status of your instance. 

- Disable battery optimization of the cell phone that is connected, even if it is just an emulator (example for android https://youtu.be/Z1baLLXyvTM).    

- Monitor the attributes of this method.
