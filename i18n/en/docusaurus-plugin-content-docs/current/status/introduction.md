### Concept

This is a difficult topic lol, maybe because I've never used this feature all that much I never noticed it's worth it. I also donâ€™t really look at people's status since I only use WhatsApp as a means of communication but anyways this feature is available to anyone to be able to use however they see fit. If you, like me, barely know this feature, it is "lost" in a tab between Conversations and Calls, below I will list some images that explain, according to Whatsappp itself, what the feature is for
