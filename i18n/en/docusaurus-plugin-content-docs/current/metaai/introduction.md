## Integration with Meta AI on Z-API

Meta AI offers a range of advanced functionalities that transform WhatsApp into a true digital assistant, aiming to make the user's daily life more practical and interactive. With Meta AI, users can conduct searches directly within the app without needing to open browsers, and they receive personalized suggestions for actions and events, such as restaurant recommendations, travel destinations, and even activity planning based on specified preferences and needs.

One of the features is the "Imagine" functionality, which allows the creation of images from textual descriptions provided by the user, integrating a unique visual element into interactions. This approach expands the possibilities for service and creativity, providing support and solutions with quick and engaging responses.

Now, Z-API enables businesses and developers to automate conversations, respond intelligently, and significantly enhance their customer experience. This connectivity allows user interactions to be more dynamic, intuitive, and effective, adding value to both support and overall customer engagement.

:::warning
This feature is only available for personal WhatsApp accounts, meaning it is not accessible for business accounts.
