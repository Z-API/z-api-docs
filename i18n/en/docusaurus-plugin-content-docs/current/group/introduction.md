### Concept 

In this topic you will get to know all of the methods available for manipulating groups.

As I said before for WhatsApp everything's a chat, knowing that the group is nothing more than a chat and basically everything you send/receive in chat you can send/receive with the groups. The group has an ID/Phone that is nothing more than the phone of the person who created it concatenated with a timestamp something similar to "5511999999999-162327528", and it is this ID/Phone that you will use as a phone to send to your groups . To get this ID/Phone use the get/chats method.

In this topic you will also find methods for creating and managing groups.

:::tip Group ID/phone

To better emphasize, think that the id/phone of the group is the number of who created it concatenated with a timestamp, something like this 5511999999999 - 1623275280
