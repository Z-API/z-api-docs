## The differences between Z-API and Whatsapp Business API 


Which is best for you for you? 

Exemplifying the use of WhatsApp’s API: WhatsApp in the beginning of this tool's development, made a strategic decision and opted to keep its API closed. Very different from what happened to major players of this segment. This means the developers didn’t have any room or opportunity to integrate their solutions and technologies in WhatsApp’s software;

Mainly in this case we are talking about a company with multiple solutions in the market, like for example: CRM , ERP systems and even creation of popular chatbots and even Ecommerce or retail companies for real-time notification service of a customer's purchase status. In this period a lot of DEVs made or looked for personalized gateways that could provide them with access to WhatsApp’s API. These solutions could still be found on github. The problem with using these libraries is that WhatsApp makes updates which makes the solutions out of date and as a rule when using these libraries the numbers were immediately banned.

With time, these companies are becoming more conscious of how using an API like this could make for an easier time getting the business started, not to mention the numerous business possibilities.

We all know just how big this market is, but let’s go deeper into the numbers. Beyond being the most used messaging in the world with its 1,7 billion users today, the majority of business happens in the tool. A few of the reasons why tons of businesses are using this is because the user could center everything in just one channel. This means more practicality, agility to manage your business in one place and bring your contacts closer. Companies started to surge in the market offering their APIs to work with WhatsApp. As a rule, they all work on the basis of WhatsApp WEB protocol and of course Z-API also provides WhatsApp API. We developed our solution in 2019. As soon as we integrated with a Brazilian solution, soon came numerous DEV’s and business partners from all over the world to also begin the integration process with us. 

We always make very clear the purpose of our solution and we have carried it with us everywhere, “Z-API wings for your imagination”. We want to give possibilities to DEV’s, technological solutions and software houses to develop extraordinary products and businesses with the best technology on the market, Quality service and a Brazilian solution that you pay in REAL that gives you the liberty to create

In 2017, WhatsApp opened access to its official API. In the beginning, WhatsApp official was tested behind closed doors and only a handful of global companies could get their hands on it. However with time, more and more organizations obtained access to WhatsApp’s official API. 







The order of cooperation is such that, to connect to the official API you will need to coordinate your connection with the official partners of WhatsApp. This means that you will need to work with middle men that are designed to provide an API and moderate your activities under current WhatsApp regulations. This implies that a great number of restrictions, which will be displayed in the table at the bottom. You can check out the current list of official partners here: https://www.facebook.com/business/partner-directory/search?solution_type=messaging.  This is very important because some businesses are tricking their clients, calling themselves official partners of WhatsApp.

In this case, is the correct way to use the official API? Let’s patiently analyze this. The first thing to decide is: why do you need an API? Both options will have advantages and disadvantages. WhatsApp API clearly has more  notoriety, mainly with its “officiality” and security. Nonetheless, there are various significant limitations which not every business will be able to work with WhatsApp API. We highlighted them separately:

## Official API disadvantages:

Price: the official API membership fee can range from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars. That’s not counting costs and individual WhatsApp messaging fees. In addition, the price of fees are dictated by WhatsApp itself (in its home country's currency), it’s not always possible to come to a more personalized agreement with a middleman. You can read more about this in their official developers website: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#usdusd 
Even so, those who still wish to connect to the official API will have to have a minimum volume of 15.000 messages monthly, which is not a viable option for every business. So, for example finance and real estate can be interesting sectors for real estate. Also businesses that sell vitamins or medication can’t obtain approval for the messenger. Working with an official representative of WhatsApp and obtaining their API will also demand a lot of energy from you. Collecting and processing documents, approving inspections, developing methods; all of this could take quite some time and still end up in failure.  Unfortunately, this risk exists. Cell phone dependency General Data Protection laws, delays in receiving updates and blocking of numbers.


## Official API advantages:

### Engagement and easiness:  

WhatsApp permits you to reply faster. in addition, there is in increase in feedback and customer engagement;

### Marketing:

Businesses can send personalized messages, alert promotions as well as information and news.

### Centralization of information:

The integration of the app with other systems includes all of the information presented in each of them, avoiding the loss of important information.
### Metrics and reports:

Depending on which program  your app is integrated, it is possible to extract important data about your customer service on the platform (if the system you are integrated with has this functionality);

### Can you imagine being banned by WhatsApp?

According to some WhatsApp statistics, the messenger blocks around 2.000.000 users per month who violate WhatsApp’s terms and agreement. 

However this doesn’t mean that non official API’s are irresponsible with their clients. For example, Z-API for the users security provides clients with individual IP,  executes secure authorization and has a system of artificial protectors, like a queue to send messages to prevent sending messages en masse and protecting them from being banned.

Also, there are systems that emulate a telephone in a computer so that the work doesn’t depend on a physical device. Of course, these methods won’t work if the user neglects the rules for working with clients on WhatsApp and sends spam. Even with the official API, it is still possible to be banned for violating the politics of WhatsApp. However, if you combine the tools of security from Z-API with use within the recommendations of WhatsApp you will be much more secure.

After analyzing the main points, you can go straight to what is the most interesting part, that is the analysis. Comparing which of the two solutions suits you best with WhatsApp. Let’s start with the benefits of Z-API:
