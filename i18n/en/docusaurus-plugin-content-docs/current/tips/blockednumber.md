## Introduction

### Good practices! 


We created this topic to share a little bit of what we learned about good practices with the intention of avoiding the nuisance of being blocked or banned on WhatsApp.



We would like to start by sharing the following reflection with you, it is very probable that you receive various messages in a day, those being sent by stores, promotions, telemarketers and so on. Now think, just through WhatsApp how many of those messages do you recieve? Probably none or very few isn’t that true? Even with that being the case WhatsApp allows you to mark those messages as spam and lets you block those numbers and contacts. 



# WHATSAPP DOESN'T ALLOW SPAM


WhatsApp is very rigorous when the topic is about sending spam and that is why we pay more attention to them than regular SMS messages. Why is it that we let various texts accumulate and yet we just can’t keep ourselves from looking at our phone when someone sends us a WhatsApp? Because we know that we rarely receive spam on WhatsApp and we know it will most likely be someone that we know trying to get into contact and rarely does someone we know send us promotions or things alike.

## How many messages can i send?


Quantity is something very important, however it is not about how many messages you can send. The key is all about _WHO CAN I_ send many messages to 


We always use the same case of the oldest client we have, Who today sends promotional messages to more than 80 thousand people daily and has never had his number blocked. When we talked to him and asked about how he was pulling this off, he kindly shared the following techniques: 




- First: To receive messages about promotions the recipient needs to add the company’s number as one of their contacts and send them a message saying “i want promotions”. This simple actions significantly lowers the chances of being blocked because with his number in our agenda and starting the conversation the buttons displayed for blocking and  marking as spam do not show; 


- Second: He personalizes the texts with information from the recipient, so the messages won’t be exactly the same;

- Third: Always give them an option to stop receiving the messages. Example: “type 2 to stop receiving messages”. With this he monitors the webhooks making sure he takes out any of the numbers that do not wish to receive anymore messages. 

- Fourth: He only sends messages through his broadcast list  

**Resumo**

- Avoid sending messages to people who aren’t in your contacts list.

- Personalize messages with information from your recipient. In case that is not possible, use random attributes to make each message different. 

- try to convince the recipient to interact with your number. Especially if you know he doesn't have your number saved in his contacts list.

- Offer an option for them to not receive anymore messages and monitor your webhooks to be able to treat those interactions and..
                                                                                                                                                     
- If possible only send messages through your broadcast list.

If only 3% of your recipients mark your messages as spam your number will be banned!!!
