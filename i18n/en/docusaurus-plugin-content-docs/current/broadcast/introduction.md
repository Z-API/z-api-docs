## Transmission list 

As I said before, for WhatsApp everything is a chat and in the case of the broadcast list it is no different, just like in the case of groups you can easily get your broadcast lists through the get/chats method, the broadcast lists come with an ID/Phone concatenating with the word "-broadcast" which would look something like "1624901640-broadcast".

You can use all methods of the messaging session to send text and files to your broadcast list by passing the broadcast list ID/Phone.

Unlike groups, all interactions and responses to messages sent by a broadcast list generate individual interactions, that is, if the recipient manifests himself, you can interact with him individually.
